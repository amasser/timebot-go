# Timebot

**Timebot-go** is a **Slack** bot for holding everyday survey. The bot asks developers how much did they work that day. It also asks on which project they have been working for.

If developer doesn't reply, the bot reminds him about the question. The developer can also log time for any day of the year (except the future days). If a developer didn't log time for previous day, the bot will remind him to report the time in the morning. If a project doesn't exist, a developer can create it. The bot can also provide a time report for a week and since the beginning of the month.
